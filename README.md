# QuickDraw

 QuickDraw is a framework that allows users to upload DICOM images and run off-the-shelf models to generate 3D segmentation masks. In addition, our tool allows users to edit, export, and evaluate segmentation masks to iteratively improve state-of-the-art models through active learning. This document will provide an overview of core functionalities of QuickDraw within the OHIF Viewer extension panel.
